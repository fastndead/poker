# What's plannig poker?
Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. You can read more on the topik on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

# Rationale
There are many similar applications out there with similar functionality, but every one have some downfalls (eg. paid premium, too simple and urly of a design, too complicated and ugly of a design etc.). I decided to take it uppon myself to change it creating the most simple but tastefully designed application for such and easy but impotant task. 

# Technologies
- React 18
- React-Spring
- Express.js
- Socket.io
- Tailwind CSS
